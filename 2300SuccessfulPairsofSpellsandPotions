/*
Hint-
(1/3)
Notice that if a spell and potion pair is successful, then the spell and all stronger potions will be successful too.
(2/3)
Thus, for each spell, we need to find the potion with the least strength that will form a successful pair.
(3/3)
We can efficiently do this by sorting the potions based on strength and using binary search.
