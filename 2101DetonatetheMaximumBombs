/*
Hint-
(1/4)
How can we model the relationship between different bombs? Can "graphs" help us?
(2/4)
Bombs are nodes and are connected to other bombs in their range by directed edges.
(3/4)
If we know which bombs will be affected when any bomb is detonated, 
how can we find the total number of bombs that will be detonated if we start from a fixed bomb?
(4/4)
Run a Depth First Search (DFS) from every node, 
and all the nodes it reaches are the bombs that will be detonated.
