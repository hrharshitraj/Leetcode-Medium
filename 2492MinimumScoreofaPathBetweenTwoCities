/*
Hint-
(1/3)
Can you solve the problem if the whole graph is connected?
(2/3)
Notice that if the graph is connected, you can always use any edge of the graph in your path.
(3/3)
How to solve the general problem in a similar way? 
Remove all the nodes that are not connected to 1 and n, then apply the previous solution in the new graph.
